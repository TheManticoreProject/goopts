## Overview of Positional Argument Types

- **Integer Positional Argument**: This argument type allows users to provide integer values as input, making it useful for scenarios that require numerical data. The position of the argument in the command line is crucial, as it determines its significance in the command.

- **String Positional Argument**: This type enables users to input string values as positional arguments. It is ideal for accepting inputs such as filenames, URLs, or other string data, where the order of the arguments matters.

By leveraging these positional argument types, you can enhance user experience and ensure that your command-line applications are both powerful and easy to use.
